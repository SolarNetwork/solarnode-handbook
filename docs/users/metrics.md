# Metrics

SolarNode supports collecting and storing timestamped, named data point values locally in SolarNode.
You might describe a metric like _the power output of a solar inverter at noon on 2024-07-18_.
Metrics are not uploaded to SolarNetwork: they are specific to each node and can be used by plugins
to monitor data points over time.

A _metric_ in SolarNode has this basic structure:

| Property | Example | Description |
|:---------|:--------|:------------|
| `timestamp` | `2024-07-18 19:48:50.003767Z` | The date the metric was created. |
| `type`      | `s` | A classifier. The `s` type represents a raw "sample". Other types can be used to represent other metric types, such as computed aggregation values. |
| `name`      | `gridPrice` | An arbitrary name for the metric. Typically these should be concise and use an expression-friendly syntax of just letters, numbers, and underscores. |
| `value`     | `123.4` | The metric numeric value, as a 64-bit floating-point number. |


See the [Metric Harvester](./datum-filters/metric-harvester.md) filter as a way of collecting
metrics from [datum](./datum.md) generated by Datum Source plugins. The
[Metrics](./setup-app/tools/metrics.md) page in the SolarNode UI offers a way to monitor
metric collection.
