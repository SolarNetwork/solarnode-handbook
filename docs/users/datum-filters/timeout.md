# Timeout Datum Filter

The [Timeout Datum Filter][src] provides a way to generate a datum if a matching source ID is not
seen within a configurable timeout.

The datum generated by this filter will be empty, aside from a possible tag and status property
depending on the settings configured. You can use an [Expression Filter](./expression.md) to
populate datum properties, taking into consideration if the datum is a "timeout" datum if required.
For example you could configure the <b>Tag</b> setting with `timeout`, and then in the Expression
Filter use the <b>Required Tag</b> property to only execute when that tag is present.

This filter is provided by the [Standard Datum Filters][sdf] plugin.

In addition to the [Common Settings][datumfilter-common-settings], the following general settings are available:

| Setting             | Description                                                       |
|:--------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Output Source ID    | The source ID of the timeout datum stream. Often the **Source ID** pattern matches this exactly. |
| Timeout             | When greater than `0` then wait at most this amount of milliseconds for a matching source ID to be seen before generating an empty timeout datum with the **Output Source ID**. As long as a matching source ID is seen before this timeout occurs, no additional datum will be generated. Input datum are always passed through. This means a datum for **Output Source ID** will always be generated at at least this frequency: either as an input datum passed through this filter or a timeout datum generated by this filter. |
| Tag                 | An optional tag to include in generated timeout datum. |
| Status Property     | An optional status property to include in generated timeout datum. The value of the property will be **Status Value**. |
| Status Value        | If **Status Property** is configured, the value to use for the status property in generated timeout datum. |
| Persist Output      | If enabled then process and persist the generated timeout datum. Otherwise process the generated timeout datum without persisting them. Input datum are unaffected by this setting. |
