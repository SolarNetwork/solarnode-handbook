# Datum Sources

Datum Sources are services that capture data from devices or services and generate
[datum](../datum.md) out of that data, to be uploaded to SolarNet. They are provided
by SolarNode plugins.

This section does not detail every available Datum Source. Instead just some popular ones are
highlighted.
