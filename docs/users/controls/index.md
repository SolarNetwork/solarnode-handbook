# Controls

Controls are services that allow SolarNode to make changes on devices or services. For example
a configurable setpoint on a solar inverter could be configured as a SolarNode control, and
then that setpoint could be manipulated by SolarNode.

This section does not detail every available Control. Instead just some popular ones are
highlighted.
