# Login

You must log in to SolarNode to access its functions. The login credentials will have been created
when you first set up SolarNode and [associated it with your SolarNetwork
account](../getting-started.md#associate-your-solarnode-with-solarnetwork). The default **Username**
will be your SolarNetwork account email address, and the password will have been [randomly generated
and shown to you](../getting-started.md#accept-the-invitation-on-solarnode).

!!! tip

	You can change your SolarNode username and password after logging in. **Note** these
	credentials are not related, or tied to, your SolarNetwork login credentials.
