# Datum Filter Recipes

This section focuses on [Datum Filters](../../users/datum-filters/index.md), referred to as simply "filters" here.
Filters are powerful and flexible and with that comes a fair amount of complexity, especially when you are just
getting started.

If you are looking to configure filters in SolarNode, check out the [Main Filter
Chain](./main-filter-chain.md) recipe -- that recipe applies to nearly all SolarNode deployments.

!!! tip

	In SolarNodeOS the `solarnode-app-datumfilters` package provides a core set of common filters.
	You can install that on the [Tools > Packages](../../users/setup-app/system/packages.md) page
	in SolarNode, or with `sudo apt install solarnode-app-datumfilters` on the command line.
